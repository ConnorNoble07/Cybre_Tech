			<h2>Celestial Forge: Councils of the Gods</h2>
				<p>Celestial Forge is an RPG in which players take the reins as a mortal who is searching for more in their life, including their research into many polytheistic religions from ancient civilizations. They save someone in need, but it turns out this old man is Odin, Allfather of the Norse Gods. Odin tells them of the Grand Council of Gods, a Concil of all sorts of Gods from different religions. Odin also says he's been looking for a champion in the Gauntlet of the Gods. The Gauntlet is a trial where Gods choose a champion to enter representing them, and the winner is granted Godhood. The player accepts Odin's offer, and they are transported to the building that houses the Grand Council. Zeus, Ares, Mimir, Njord, Anubis, Thoth, Rama, Mercury, Juno, Rhiannon, Epona, Xochiquetzal, Tlaloc, Kon, Viracocha, Shango, Esu, Omoikane, Tsukuyomi, MƒÅui, and Rongo are all in the Pantheon. Zeus and Odin start chatting. Zeus has brought his son, Hercules, a Demi-God already, to be his champion. Odin is outraged by Zeus brining a Demi-God to the Gauntlet of the Gods, a challenge meant for mortals. Zeus is hosting the Gauntlet in Olympus however, so he makes the rules, and he's bringing Hercules. Mimir tells Odin to calm his head, and that there's nothing he can do. The mortal starts to worry about the challenges that lie ahead, as they have no weapons. Odin offers them a choice of three different weapons. A sword and shield, a spear and chain, and a set of two daggers. The mortal can choose between the three options. Odin then can send the player to one of three places depending on the weapons chosen. If the sword and shield are chosen, you are sent to retrieve the Aegis from Athena's chambers, then The Harpe, a sword that still remains in Medusa's corpse. If the spear is chosen, Odin sends the mortal to retrieve Gungnir, his spear, from a theif that turns out to be Baldur, which the mortal has to kill. Mistletoe is found by the mortal, and cuts it with the spear, then stabs Baldur, killing him. If the daggers are chosen, odin sends the mortal to get Carnwennan and Heavenly Sword Dagger from Durga. After whichever mission Odin sent the mortal on, they return to the Pantheon, and see the champion of Thoth, a man named Mario Lombardi.</p>
