			<h2></h2>
				<p>&nbsp; In my early life, I was unaware of everything that was wrong with me. I found that I was autistic at the age of 15. I later fouund out I also have ADHD. My teen years are for the next section however.My childhood was a tramatic one. My father is a very negative figure in my life. It makes me happy that I haven't spoken to him in almost 3 years. Some stuff he did was; threaten me with a knife when I was four, I hid in a cabnet and cried. He poured water on me and got really mad when I didn't change my shirt. I ran around the yard while he chased me, he eventually got in his truck and my brother tackeled me, my father, a 300-400 lbs. man, sat on me, an 8 or 9 year old, and pinned my arms behind my back, it felt like he was crushing my ribs. To add insult to injury, my mom smashed my 2ds and I wasn't allowed to go to the dairy princess parade, which was that day. I was grounded for a while after that. Once, on valentines day of 2019 or 2020, we went to the Syracuse Mall, we went to an escape room place and had been before, it terrified us and me and my brother were crying through the spy themed escape room, until I found an emergency exit and we left. I wouldn't be allowed to play video games until June. Moving through the pandemic, my dad was cheating on my mom with my best friend's <span class="important">(Darvay Williams')</span> mom, he made me and my brother lie to our mom about it. Eventually, I would relize the piece of garbage my dad was on my 13th birthday, when he was at a race track with my best friends mom and my brother. Christmas of 2020 was the last time I went to see him. My life has imoproved tenfold since I stopped seeing him. This is why, the day I turned thirteen, is the day my childhood ended, to me at least.</p>
