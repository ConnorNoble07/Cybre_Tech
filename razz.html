		<h2>It's Magic! A background on magic.</h2>
			<p>In this world, there are two battling factions of magic: Mana and Valor. Mana is the good side of this battle, using the life magic against evil. Mana has a side effect of flowers often growing around areas mana magic was used. These flowers are often not native to the area they grow. Valor is the evil form of magic that infests the world. It leaves trails of death in its wake. Valor, unlike the wooden staffs used in mana magic, uses bones to conjure its magic. While it's rare for someone to be able to use one of the magics, it's even more rare for someone to have access to both forms, however it's not impossible.</p>
