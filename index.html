		<h2>Planned Company Departments-</h2>
			<br>
		<h3>Game Studio (Cybre Games)-</h3>
			<p>The public facing passion project of mine, Cybre Games focus on designing games for ideas I've always wanted to see played and experienced by thousands to millions of people. While a focus on my ideas will be in place to start, the ideas of others will be a priority as well. The game department was the first invisioned, being the first goal of this company before P.F.W. was invisioned.</p>
				<br>
		<h3>TV, Movie, and Animation Studio (Coggs)-</h3>
			<p>Our television studio will be called Coggs, and it will make many shows and movies, both animated and not. </p>
				<br>
		<h3>Technology and Engineering (Cybre Space)-</h3>
			<p>While our vision involves games, it also involves the future of engineering and robotics, hence, Cybre Space. However, this means we have two divisions of Cybre Space: Robotics and Hardware.</p>
				<br>
		<h3>Reasearch and Development (Project Flaming Wolf)-</h3>
			<p>The goal of P.F.W. is to make the world a much better place. We can see glaring issues such as hunger, thirst, useless wars, pointless violence, and more. It's time someone with money and power used it to stop the problems of the world, not make them worse. P.F.W. is the means to exactlly the thing I want, an improved world. While Cybre Games publicly apears as my passion project, this is truly what I am passionate about, fixing this world 8 billion people call home. While being the last department invisioned, it is, by far the most important department.</p>
			<br>
		<h3>Planned HQ Location-</h3>
		<p>Zip Code: 13617, Canton, New York, St. Lawrence County, United States of America, HQ location may change on future date, will always remain in New York State.</p>
		
		<h3>Future Expantion-</h3>
		<p>Our first expantions will be in New York State and eventually all throughout the U.S. More expantion should come internationally.</p>
