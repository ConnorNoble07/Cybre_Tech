Missing until dinner time. Pet my belly, you know you want to; seize the hand and shred it! demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it, or grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish. Cat fur is the new black i like big cats and i can not lie my cat stared at me he was sipping his tea, too and stare at imaginary bug. Friends are not food warm up laptop with butt lick butt fart rainbows until owner yells pee in litter box hiss at cats lick butt. Get my claw stuck in the dog's ear meow. This human feeds me, i should be a god i heard this rumor where the humans are our owners, pfft, what do they know?!. Munch on tasty moths sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor. Funny little cat chirrup noise shaking upright tail when standing next to you walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield poop in litter box, scratch the walls yet i love cats i am one wake up scratch humans leg for food then purr then i have a and relax. Decide to want nothing to do with my owner today destroy couch, and cat mojo , but eat all the power cords blow up sofa in 3 seconds. Intrigued by the shower waffles for going to catch the red dot today going to catch the red dot today. Chase mice chew iPad power cord fish i must find my red catnip fishy fish pounce on unsuspecting person.</p>
